# SizeAdvisor - Men's T-Shirt and Pant Size Calculator

## Introduction
SizeAdvisor is a simple yet useful tool designed to help men find their ideal t-shirt and pant sizes based on their weight and height. It takes user input for weight and height, processes the data, and suggests the appropriate sizes for a comfortable fit.

This project is especially handy for online shoppers who want to ensure they order clothing items that fit them perfectly without the need for trying them on physically.

## Features
- **Easy-to-Use Interface**: SizeAdvisor offers an intuitive user interface where users can quickly input their weight and height.

- **Accurate Sizing Recommendations**: Using predefined size ranges, the application calculates the best-fitting t-shirt and pant sizes for the user.

- **For Men**: SizeAdvisor is specifically tailored for men, ensuring that the size recommendations are suitable for their clothing needs.

## How to Use
1. **Clone the Repository**: Begin by cloning this repository to your local machine.
git clone https://github.com/AbdumajidovAvazbek/SizeAdvisor.git

2. **Build and Run**: Open the project in your preferred development environment and build/run the application.

3. **Input Your Data**: Enter your weight (in kilograms) and height (in centimeters) in the provided fields.

4. **Get Size Recommendations**: Click the "Calculate Sizes" button to receive size recommendations for both t-shirts and pants.

## Technologies Used
- C# for the backend logic.
- WPF (Windows Presentation Foundation) for the graphical user interface (GUI).
- Machine Learning (ML) algorithms (Regression, Decision Trees, or Neural Networks) for size prediction (optional, if you choose to implement ML-based sizing).

## Future Improvements
Here are some potential enhancements for SizeAdvisor:
- Implement machine learning models to improve size predictions based on historical data and customer feedback.
- Add support for additional clothing items like jeans, shorts, and more.
- Create a web-based or mobile application for wider accessibility.
